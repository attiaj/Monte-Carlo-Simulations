    "For part 1, we generated x uniformly between the bounds of the integral, 0 and 1, because we are integrating with respect to the Lebesgue measure, which is the probability distribution of a uniform random variable. We then transformed these generated x into the integrand $(1-x^2)^{3/2}$. By the mean value theorem, the average of these generated integrands multiplied by the length of the integral bounds (1-0=1) gives us an approximation of the integral's value.\n",

    "For part 1, we need to find the best constant c($\\lambda$) for the AR method. Taking Exp($\\lambda$) as our g(x) function, we calculate $\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$, then take the derivative to find the maximum value that this function can take. The derivative = 0 when x = 0 (minimum possible value of x) or when x* = $\\frac{2}{1-\\lambda}$, which is our maximum value. Therefore, $\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ must be less than or equal to its evaluation at x*, and we get c($\\lambda$) = $\\frac{f(x*)}{g(x*)}$ = $\\frac{2e^{-2}}{\\lambda(1-\\lambda)^2}$"

    "For part 2, we want to make the AR method the most efficient as we can: a uniform RV gets accepted if it's less than $\\frac{f(X)}{cg(X)}$. The probability of acceptance is the expected value of this formula, which comes out to be $\\frac{1}{c}$. Therefore, if we want our probability of acceptance to be the highest possible value, we need to minimize c, to maximize the acceptance rate. If we take the derivative of our c($\\lambda$) function, set it equal to 0, we get $\\lambda$* = 1/3. From a boundary check, we verify that this is a minimum, and thus our optimal $\\lambda$*"
